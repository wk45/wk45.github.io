## Research Interest
Functional Data Anaylsis and Bayesian Inference

## Main Projects

The main research is about Functional registration using Fisher-Rao metric in Riemannian manifold. 

#### • Peak Persistence Diagrams ([PPD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04826))

PPD is a very simple but novel visualization tool for the functional estimation.


#### • Phase Alignment of functions by Trajectory ([Path Analysis](/Projects/PathAnalysis/Visualization/test99.html))


Functional registration can be achieved by investigating the path of the mean of aligned functions by projecting them onto lower dimensional space via functional principal component analysis (FPCA).

#### • Bayesian Functional Alignment

## Miscellaneous Projects

#### • Network Analysis via Bayesian Method ([Hierarchical Latent SVD Model](/Projects/HLSVD/HSVD.pdf))

In social network data analysis, latent space models (LDMs) are widely used to uncover underlying structures among nodes by embedding them in a latent space. These models can capture various relational metrics—such as distances, classes, and clusters—that facilitate further statistical analysis. Among the different types of LDMs, Hoff (2008) introduced an eigenmodel-based latent space to account for *homophily*, the tendency of similar nodes to connect.

> Homophily helps explain common patterns in social networks, including transitivity (“a friend of a friend is a friend”), balance (“the enemy of my friend is an enemy”), and the formation of cohesive subgroups of nodes” (Hoff 2008).

The main objective of this project is to incorporate hierarchical modeling to induce a shrinkage effect, which improves parameter estimation by borrowing strength across the network structure.

#### • Topological Data Analysis
Topological approach to a geometric data can reduce the complexity.
