## Research Interest
Functional Data Anaylsis and Bayesian Inference

## Main Projects

My primary research focuses on functional registration using the Fisher-Rao metric within a Riemannian manifold framework. This approach enables the alignment of functional data in a geometrically meaningful way, facilitating more accurate statistical analysis and inference in the context of functional data.

#### • Peak Persistence Diagrams ([PPD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04826))

PPD is a simple yet novel visualization tool designed for functional estimation.


#### • Phase Alignment of functions by Trajectory ([Path Analysis](/Projects/PathAnalysis/Visualization/test99.html))

Functional registration is accomplished by analyzing the trajectory of the mean function after alignment. This is done by projecting the aligned functions onto a lower-dimensional space using Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), enabling effective visualization and interpretation of the registration process.

#### • Bayesian Functional Alignment

## Miscellaneous Projects

#### • Network Analysis via Bayesian Method ([Hierarchical Latent SVD Model](/Projects/HLSVD/HSVD.pdf))

In social network data analysis, latent space models (LDMs) are widely used to uncover underlying structures among nodes by embedding them in a latent space. These models can capture various relational metrics—such as distances, classes, and clusters—that facilitate further statistical analysis. Among the different types of LDMs, Hoff (2008) introduced an eigenmodel-based latent space to account for *homophily*, the tendency of similar nodes to connect.

> Homophily helps explain common patterns in social networks, including transitivity (“a friend of a friend is a friend”), balance (“the enemy of my friend is an enemy”), and the formation of cohesive subgroups of nodes” (Hoff 2008).

The main objective of this project is to incorporate hierarchical modeling to induce a shrinkage effect, which improves parameter estimation by borrowing strength across the network structure.

#### • Topological Data Analysis
Topological approach to a geometric data can reduce the complexity.
